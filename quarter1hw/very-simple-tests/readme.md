# Simple Test Writing

Here are 3 files that you should add tests to. There are more explicit instructions in the files themselves, but you should do them in this order:

1. romanNumerals.js
2. topThreeN.js
3. sortingCallbacks.js

Add tests using `mocha` and `chai` -- you'll have to install these software packages using `npm`. Checkout the documentation for more information on getting started with `mocha` and `chai`:

* [Mocha.js getting started](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started)
* [Chai Expect Syntax](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/#expect)
